# Automated Weather Station

This program is designed for the operation of sensor equipment to detect wind conditions to assist in the determination of flight go/no go conditions.  Current hardware includes:
* Wind Vane
* Anemometer
* Arduino Uno

# Features
At current, this software and hardware will generate wind speed, and wind direction.  Eventually, we hope to include temperature, humidity, and baromtric pressure.

# Moving Forward
* Integrate HIH6130 sensor
